# ContactUsAPI

I have used REST to create this contact us API.
The were some problem with sharing my project in here, so I have uploaded file I made changes in as well as zip of the whole cakePHP project, sorry for the inconvience

Contact Us page is submitted using AJAX request.

I have uploaded the database as well, it's called test.sql. To use this database you'll have to make changes in app.php file (<project_name>/config/app.php). In this file in "Datasources" update your MySQL username, MySQL password and database name.

As per our discussion I have made the updates in the assignment.
